github is a client , github is a place which can host git repositories ...




Anything which we can generate on server can be put nside gitignore...




we put node module , dist folder and .parcel-cache in our gitignongore 
 ***

we don't put node module on git because our package-lock.json has sufficient information to recreate node modules.
***


never keep package-lock.json in gitignore agar kaar diye to then we got the issue ki it is working on my system but not working in production
